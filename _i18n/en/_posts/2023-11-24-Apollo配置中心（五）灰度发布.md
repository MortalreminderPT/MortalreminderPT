## Understanding Gray Release

Gray release is a deployment strategy that allows for a smooth transition between black and white, facilitating A/B testing where some users continue with feature A while others experience feature B. If users show no objections to feature B, the deployment gradually shifts until all users are on board.

## Gray Release Functionality in Apollo

1. For configurations with significant impacts on programs, they can be initially activated on one or more instances, observed for a period, and then fully deployed if no issues arise.
2. For configurations requiring tuning, gray release enables A/B testing. Different configurations can be applied to different machines, continuously adjusted and evaluated until optimal configurations are identified for full deployment.

For details on how to implement gray release in Apollo, refer to the [Gray Release Guide](https://www.apolloconfig.com/#/zh/usage/apollo-user-guide) in the Apollo User Guide.
