## Snapshot Versions

It's important to note that the **version** tag in the `pom.xml` files shown below carries the suffix: `-SNAPSHOT`.

```xml
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
  ...
  <groupId>...</groupId>
  <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>
  ...
  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <name>Maven Quick Start Archetype</name>
  ...
```

The `SNAPSHOT` signifies that the value represents the **"latest" code** on the development branch, which isn't guaranteed to be stable or static. In contrast, code in a "release" version (any version value without the `SNAPSHOT` suffix) remains immutable.

In other words, snapshot versions are the "in-progress" versions before the final "release" version. These snapshots are considered "older" than their release counterparts.

During the [release process](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-release-plugin/), a version like **x.y-SNAPSHOT** transitions to **x.y**. Additionally, the release process increments the development version to **x.(y+1)-SNAPSHOT**. For example, version **1.0-SNAPSHOT** would be released as version **1.0**, while the new development version becomes **1.1-SNAPSHOT**.
