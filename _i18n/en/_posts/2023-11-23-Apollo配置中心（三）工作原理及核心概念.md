## Working Principles

The architecture of Apollo is designed as depicted in the following diagram:

![Apollo Overall Architecture](\images\posts\apollo-overall-architecture.png){: style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; zoom:100%;"}

Responsibilities of each module in the diagram are outlined below:

| Module         | Responsibilities                                   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Config Service | Provides functions such as reading and pushing configurations, serving Apollo clients |
| Admin Service  | Provides functions such as modifying and releasing configurations, serving Apollo Portal (management interface) |
| Eureka         | Provides service registration and discovery. For simplicity, Eureka is currently deployed in the same JVM process as Config Service. Both Config Service and Admin Service are deployed in a stateless manner with multiple instances. Therefore, they need to register themselves with Eureka and maintain a heartbeat. |
| Meta Server    | A layer built upon Eureka, encapsulating Eureka's service discovery interface. |

- Clients access Meta Server via domain name to obtain a list of Config Service instances (IP+Port), and then directly access the service via IP+Port. Load balancing and error retry are performed on the client side.
- The Portal accesses Meta Server via domain name to obtain a list of Admin Service instances (IP+Port), and then directly accesses the service via IP+Port. Load balancing and error retry are performed on the Portal side.
- To simplify deployment, Config Service, Eureka, and Meta Server are actually deployed in the same JVM process.

## Execution Flow

1. Upon startup, Config/Admin Service automatically registers with the Eureka service registry and periodically sends keep-alive heartbeats.
2. Apollo Client and Portal management end access a Meta Server via the configured domain name, which is then load balanced by a Software Load Balancer before being assigned to a specific Meta Server.
3. Meta Server retrieves service information for Config Service and Admin Service from Eureka, acting as an Eureka Client.
4. Meta Server retries if it fails to obtain service information for Config Service and Admin Service (IP+Port).
5. Once the correct service information for Config Service and Admin Service is obtained, Apollo Client provides configuration acquisition and real-time update functions for the application via Config Service. The Apollo Portal management end provides configuration addition, modification, and release functions via Admin Service.

## Core Concepts

| Concept      | Understanding                                                                                          | Keywords       |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| application  | The application in which the Apollo client runs.                                                       | appId          |
| environment  | The environment in which the Apollo client runs.                                                       | env            |
| cluster      | A grouping of different instances under an application, such as grouping by data center.               | cluster        |
| namespace    | A grouping of different configurations under an application.                                           | namespaces     |
